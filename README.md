# LoRaWAN

This is a project to test the [Single Channel LoRaWAN Gateway](https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway). I developed two clients with the BME280 sensor and the NEO-6M GPS sensor. The software is written in C/Arduino for [TTGO Lora32 v1](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/32840238513.html) and built using Platformio. This firmware joins TTN by ABP and sends the measurement data to Node-Red.
