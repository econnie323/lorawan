# lorawan

This is a project to test the [Single Channel LoRaWAN Gateway](https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway). I entered two clients with the BME280 sensor and the NEO-6M GPS. The software is written in C/Arduino for TTGO Lora32 v1, built using platformio. This firmware joins TTN by ABP and sends the measurement data to Node-Red.
